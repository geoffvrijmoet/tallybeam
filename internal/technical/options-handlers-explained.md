### **1. What are the "OPTIONS handlers for all endpoints"?**

This refers to a core mechanism of **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**.

When your frontend application (running on a domain like `www.tallybeam.com`) tries to make certain types of requests to your backend API (running on a different domain like `api.tallybeam.com`), the browser, for security reasons, will first send a "preflight" request before it sends the actual `GET` or `POST` request.

*   **The Preflight Request:** This is an `OPTIONS` request sent to the same URL. Its purpose is to ask the server for permission. It's like the browser calling your API's front desk and asking, "Hey, I'm calling from `www.tallybeam.com`. Are you guys allowed to accept a `POST` request from me with an `Authorization` header?"
*   **The OPTIONS Handler's Job:** The job of the `OPTIONS` handler on your backend is to respond to this preflight request with a set of headers that say, "Yes, you are on our approved list of origins. You are allowed to use the `POST` method and include an `Authorization` header. You have permission."
*   **The Result:** If the `OPTIONS` request gets a successful response, the browser will then proceed to send the actual `POST` request. If it doesn't, the browser will block the request, and you will see a CORS error in your console.

**How the Serverless Framework Handles This:**
When you set `cors: true` in your `serverless.yml` for an HTTP event, the Serverless Framework **automatically creates these OPTIONS handlers for you.** You don't have to write any code for them. The AI's summary is simply documenting that this necessary CORS mechanism is in place for all your defined endpoints, which is a sign of a correctly configured API.
